#All checkboxes stacked up in one go.- done by Samar. on 4th May



BUGS
----
* Currently, when I create a question, I have to go seperately and create associated options...Actually it should ask me directly what options to create.
 -- a sample is created in ldap_login/groups' admin view.
 -- checkout http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/intro/tutorial02/ for more guidance.

* Currently, when any non-mandatory is in a form edit and the user doesn't submit any value for that non-mandatory question, the original value which was filled priorly, is automatically associated and NOT flushed out. Thus non-mandatory questions in an edit have a value by default, whihc is their original value. 
     --- We need prefilled forms while editing.
     --- We need to flush out all submissionAnswerOptions corresponding to that submission when saving the edited submission.

* Check the mandatoriness of submissions on SERVER SIDE though it's already working on CLIENT SIDE -- done FOR SUBMITTING, remaining for editsubmit
* during preview.. checkbooxes are shown in different questions
