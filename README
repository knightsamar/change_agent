Conventions used in the form.html for generation of form and making it easier to process
========================================================================================

1. All questions create a hidden field called *qX* where X is the questionID. 
2. This is further suffixed with a M if the question is mandatory.
            eg. *qXM
3. Then the question ID is again stored as a value in the field so that they are POSTed. They are verified on the server to check whether mandatory questions were posted or not.
4. Radio button options are named as *qX_rdb_opt*. All radio buttons belonging to a question are named similarly.
5. These radio buttons are given the value P which is the optionID from the original table. Thus the option that is selected will have it's ID stored.
            eg. qX_rdb_opt = Q
       will mean that Q option was selected for question X.
6. Checkboxes are named as *qX_chk_opt_*.
